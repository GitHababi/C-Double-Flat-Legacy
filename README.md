As we all know, C++ was created in C, and C# was created with a combination of C and C++, and as an extension, Cbb was written in C#.
This isn't meant to be used at all, but this was created as a learning experience for myself.

## Features!

- Left to Right math expressions, (PEMDAS is for losers anyway).
- Scopeless, (Classes and stuff were really just getting in the way).
- Typeless, (Invalid type cast errors really slow you down).
- Weird funky syntax, (by yours truly).
- Overridable, (Anything that exists, can be redefined).
